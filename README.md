# RaspberryPiZero_HID_MultiTool
Scripts for turning a RaspBerryPi zero into multiple HID devices including, Serial, Ethernet, Storage, HID Keyboard

Note:  This project is a compliation of several sources of scripts / config files I found for each of the various HID devices you can turn the Zero Pi into..   I put them in a single system and tied them into the pin configurations to automatically switch the zPI.

*GENERAL*
I used a USB UART board to connect to the zPi uart pins in case there were any issues with the boot or not being able to switch to serial/ethernet mode to get access to the OS on the zPI.

*Pin Modes*
